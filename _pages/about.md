I am currently a PhD candidate at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) under the supervision of [Professor Christian Muise](https://www.haz.ca/), and I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Mu Lab](https://mulab.ai/) with the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/). My interests are in researching structured learning from unstructured text. Storytelling with Automated Planning is a key part of my current research. 

Before beginning my PhD degree program, I completed an MSc. in Computer Science at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/) under the supervision of [Professor Vlado Keselj](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/), and I also worked as a Systems Analyst and Web Developer for several years. 

When I am not teaching Transformer-based Models how to tell logical, coherent, and believable stories, I enjoy reading, painting, and listening to music.
