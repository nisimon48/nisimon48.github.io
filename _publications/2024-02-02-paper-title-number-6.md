At first glance, it would seem that modern LLMs can assiduously parrot back output based on data that has previously been given to them as inputs. However they are still a long way away from coherently generating long form narratives that match defined parameters, unless they are first given a certain amount of guidance. By combining Automated Planning with Natural Language Text Generation by LLMs we can create logical, believable, and coherent stories that can be used in a wide variety of domains,for a large range of applications.
