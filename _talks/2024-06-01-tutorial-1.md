We demonstrate the role that planning, or planning-based representations, can play in narrative generation methods. The plan becomes the representation of the story and also that of the story world, and thus we use Planning to create logical, believable, and coherent stories (narratives) in a variety of domains. We  cover several techniques, including modern approaches that make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and provide the opportunity for attendees to play with the technology themselves live.
